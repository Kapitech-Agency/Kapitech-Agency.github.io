# AMS persistence and disaster recovery

## Current production mode

The live AMS remains deployable on Hostinger without an external database service. Persistent business data is stored in the server-side encrypted database file under the configured data directory.

Production requires:
- `KAPITECH_DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: 32-byte key represented as 64 hex characters or valid base64.
- `KAPITECH_DB_BACKUP_RETENTION`: optional rolling retention from 3 to 30 snapshots. Default 14.

The application creates encrypted rolling snapshots before live database replacement. Manual snapshots are available to privileged IT/Master accounts through the System Backup API.

## Private document vault

Uploaded files are stored under the server data directory in `private-documents`, outside the public static web root. Metadata is stored in the AMS database. Downloads require a valid session and the existing RBAC checks.

The upload limit is 25 MB per document. Executable MIME types are intentionally not accepted.

## Restore procedure

1. Stop application writes through the deployment/maintenance workflow.
2. Copy the current database file as a safety backup.
3. Select a `kapitech_db_*.bak` snapshot from the backup directory.
4. Verify the snapshot without changing production:
   `node scripts/restore-ams-db.mjs /absolute/path/to/backup.bak --verify-only`
5. If verification passes and the maintenance window is active, restore:
   `node scripts/restore-ams-db.mjs /absolute/path/to/backup.bak --force`
6. Ensure the same `KAPITECH_DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is present.
6. Start/redeploy AMS and run the smoke test.
7. Verify login, dashboard, finance, CRM, documents, and audit integrity.

## Relational migration target

The repository includes `docs/relational-schema.sql` as the normalized target schema. The current route layer is intentionally kept deployable on Hostinger while this database service is provisioned. The migration target covers identity, sessions, CRM, projects, proposals, invoices/payments, expenses, approvals, documents, notifications, and audit logs.

A future cutover should be performed as a controlled migration with:
- schema creation,
- full data export from the current encrypted store,
- row-count and financial reconciliation,
- dual-read verification,
- cutover,
- rollback snapshot.

The current JSON store must not be deleted until the relational cutover has passed reconciliation and rollback validation.
